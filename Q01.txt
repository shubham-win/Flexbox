CSS Grid Layout, is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system with rows and columns, 
making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. 
Like tables, grid layout allow us to align elements into columns and rows.

CSS Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout.
It is helpful in allocating and aligning the space among items in a container (made of grids). 
It works with all kinds of display devices and screen sizes.

USe one over the other--
Layout: CSS Grid is better for complex designs, gaps between block elements, and overlapping elements. Flexbox is better for small designs, content-first designs, and aligning elements.
Components: Flexbox is better for smaller components like form fields, buttons, labels, and icons. CSS Grid is better for larger components like form sections, containers, and wrappers.
Content: Flexbox works on content, while CSS Grid is based on layout
